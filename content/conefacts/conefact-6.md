title: How Seeds Get Around
---

Many cones will open its scales while still on the tree so the seeds can be carried by the wind as they fall out. Mature cones that fall to the ground with seeds still inside have the chance to make their seeds useful as well. Animals, especially squirrels and birds, will eat or transport the seeds to be planted elsewhere â€“ continuing the natural tree planting process.
