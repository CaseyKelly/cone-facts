title: How Seeds Get Around
---

A fully mature female cone will appear to have exploded and will have darkened from the green colour of its immature state. Many cones will open its scales while still on the tree so the seeds can be carried by the wind as they fall out. Mature cones that fall to the ground with seeds still inside have the chance to make their seeds useful as well. Animals, especially squirrels and birds, will eat or transport the seeds to be planted elsewhere â€“ continuing the natural tree planting process.
