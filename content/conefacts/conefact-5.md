Did you know that pinecones can stay on pine trees for more than 10 years before falling to the ground? During that time seeds for new pine trees grow under the scales of the pinecones. The scales protect the seeds from bad weatherâ€”and hungry animals. Eventually, however, the seeds need to be released so that they can grow into new trees.
