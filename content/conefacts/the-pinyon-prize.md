title: The Pinyon Prize
---
The Pinyon Pine was prized by local Indians who not only enjoyed the large edible brown nuts but used parts of the tree for a variety of medicinal purposes. Placing cones near a fire opens the scales so nuts can be easily removed. This is the only "one needle" pine in the world. Most pines have 3-5 needle sheaths.
