title: Grow Pine Trees from Seed
---

To start growing pine trees from seed, gather large brown (or slightly green) cones in fall. The cones should be closed; if open, they probably have already released their seeds. Lay the cones in an open box at room temperature. When dry, the cones will open and release their seeds. If they don't open, place the box in a hot spot until they do.
