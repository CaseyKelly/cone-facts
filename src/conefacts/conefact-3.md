title: Cones Of All Sizes
---

When it comes to size, the smallest cone measures approximately an inch, and it comes from the Canadian hemlock. The longest pine cone in the world comes from the Sugar Pine. Its cones can grow up to two feet long! And then there's the whopper of them all, the Coulter pine cone. They're named for Irish botanist Thomas Coulter. They can grow to be 8 to 16 inches long and weigh up to 10 pounds!
